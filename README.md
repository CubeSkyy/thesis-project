# Traffic light control using multiagent reinforcement learning

Document created in preparation for my thesis, otherwise referenced as Thesis Project.

Abstract:
>The existing traffic infrastructure cannot handle the current traffic demand in large city traffic networks. 
>
>Previous works based on multi-agent reinforcement learning that exploit space locality using coordination graphs have shown promising results. However, the effectiveness of exploiting time locality using sparse interactions is unknown. 
>
>This work presents a comparative study between multi-agent methods that use coordination graphs and sparse interactions in realistic traffic scenarios
